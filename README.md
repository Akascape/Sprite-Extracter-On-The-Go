# Sprite Extractor On The Go
This is an easy to use GUI (Python based) program that can unpack sprite sheet images (which are in a bundle form packed by texture packer) to multiple separated png images(transparency included).

<br>You just need the sprite sheet image and the data file(like .plist files) and then you can use this program to automatically extract all the sprite images in a separate folder.

## How To Use?
1) After opening the program, you have to first input the sprite image file(.png) and the main data file(like .plist) in their respective sections.

## Conclusion
This is a very quick and easy to use program. It can be helpful for many game developers who want to change and rebundle their sprite sheets in future. You can also use it to get good asset images of games for editing or any other purposes. I have tested it many times with game files from mini militia and it works perfectly. It supports plist, xml, json and cocos data files.
