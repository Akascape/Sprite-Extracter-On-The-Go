# Sprite-Extracter-On-The-Go
This is an easy GUI (Python based) program that can extract sprite sheet images which are in a bundle to single images(with transparency).
<br>You just need the sprite sheet image and the data file(example-.plist files) and then you can use this program to extract all the sprite images separately in a folder.
<br>HOW TO USE
<br>1)Download the 'Sprite-Extracter-on-the-go.zip' file from this page or you can also use the python based program given in the source code folder.
<br>2)Unzip the folder and run the 'Sprite Extracter on-the-go.exe' file to open it.
<br>3)You have to first input the sprite image file and the main data file(example-'.plist' file) in their respective section.
<br>4)Then just click on the extract button and it will take a few seconds to extract the sprite sheet images.
<br>5)Then check the folder which you will find in the main sprite file's folder.
<br>NOTE:
<br>1)Make sure the base name of both the files are same and they must be in the same directory(any).
<br>2)Please do not paste any files in the Program's Folder or else it might get deleted(use this folder to open the program only).
<br>3)If you extract the same files in the same location again, then the new extracted folder will replace the old folder if not renamed.
<br>This is a very fast and easy to use program and will be helpful for many game developers to change rebundle their sprite sheet in future.
<br>I have checked it many times and it works perfectly with (specially .plist files). It supports xml, json and cocos extension too.
Thanks for visiting! :)
