# Sprite Extracter On-The-Go
This is an easy GUI (Python based) program that can extract sprite sheet images which are in a bundle to single images(with transparency).
<br>You just need the sprite sheet image and the data file(example-.plist files) and then you can use this program to extract all the sprite images separately in a folder.
<br>HOW TO USE
<br>1)Download the 'Sprite-Extracter-on-the-go.zip' file from this page or you can also use the python based program given in the source code folder.
<br>2)Unzip the folder and run the 'Sprite Extracter on-the-go.exe' file to open it.
<br>3)You have to first input the sprite image file(.png) and the main data file(.plist file) in their respective section.
<br>4)Then just click on the extract button and it will take a few seconds to extract the sprite sheet images.
<br>5)Then check the folder which you will find in the main sprite file's folder.
<br>NOTE:
<br>1)Make sure the base name of both the files are same and they must be in the same directory(any).
<br>2)Please do not paste the main files in the Program's Folder or else it might get deleted(use that folder to open the program only).
<br>
<br>This is a very fast and easy to use program and will be helpful for many game developers to change and rebundle their sprite sheet in future.
<br>I have tested it many times and it works perfectly (specially with .plist files). It also supports xml, json and cocos extension.
Please open an issue if you find any error.
Thanks for visiting! :)
